                <p class="lead">After we collected our initial data we consolidated our findings and concluded that the main problems in the House Manager department consisted of lack of communication and incentive to work. Many of us being House Managers ourselves, we were able to use our own experiences at work as a guide or starting point. To narrow down the problems, we each made a list of potential problems at work. After writing them all down, we all voted on the three problems that seemed the biggest. Going through this process, along with interviews and observation, we decided to solve the problem of lack of communication between workers and the supervisors and communication between the shifts. </p>
                <p class="lead">Being a House Manager is seen as a laid back job that is not as time consuming as other on campus jobs may be. However, the mishaps that occur on the job can be big but usually occur due to small reasons. Our own boss has stated that employees do a good job for the most part, but lack of communication causes many small problems that pile up. After many prototypes, we decided to combine our ideas with an already existing system that was not being implemented completely. There is a wall outside of our supervisor’s office that had diagrams of the ballrooms. The ballrooms are one of the more important setups that the House Manager department takes care of. However, the wall was often ignored by the employees, and it was not organized in an intuitive way. We realized that many employees do not try to do anything more than the minimum requirement for the job. Because of this, we needed to design a system that would inform the average employee about what is going on. Often times, employees (besides the lead) would be unsure about what the agenda for the day is until told. This can cause inefficiency and confusion in the workplace. Therefore, we tried to keep in mind the new and seasoned employees in our design. </p>
                <p class="lead">To really narrow down on a problem, we first placed a “suggestion box” (pictured below) in the office table. We already had many problems in mind, since most of us are House Managers, but we wanted to allow the whole department to anonymously write down any problems, complaints, or suggestions. After the suggestion box, we consolidated our findings and made an affinity diagram (pictured below) to visualize and categorize the problems. Along with data received from over 20 interviews and deep hangouts between the five of us, the affinity diagram allowed us to better understand the bigger problems in the workplace. With this, we decided to tackle one big problem instead of many small ones. </p>
                <p class="lead">We decided to improve the quality of work and efficiency by designing a system that would allow employees to visualize work needed to be done. Another big design opportunity we saw was the implementation of notes, to improve communication between employees. After prototype testing numerous times, we were able to narrow the problem more. Along with this, we were able to find more efficient solutions in our design process. </p>
